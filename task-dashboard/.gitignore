Answers for reflection Questions:
# //*************************************//
Q1.How you implemented React and TypeScript features?
Ans:
-Used functional components for all UI elements (Dashboard, TaskForm, TaskFilter, TaskList, TaskItem).
-created useState to manage local component state: 
    tasks in Dashboard holds all tasks.
    filters in Dashboard tracks filter values.
    formData in TaskForm manages input values.
-used useEffect to persist tasks to localStorage:
      Load tasks on initial render.
      Save tasks whenever they change.
-Props and callbacks:
    Child components receive props (tasks, onStatusChange, onDelete, etc.).
    Actions in child components trigger callbacks to update parent state.

-Created Interfaces and types for all data structures and props:
Task, TaskFormData, FilterOptions, TaskStatus, TaskPriority.
Component props typed (TaskListProps, TaskItemProps, TaskFilterProps).

-Strict typing in callbacks:
    Status updates: (id: string, status: TaskStatus) => void
    Filter updates: (filters: FilterOptions) => void
-Type casting when necessary, e.g., casting filter select values to TaskStatus or TaskPriority.

Q2. The challenges you encountered and how you overcame them?
Ans: 
-My  Biggest challenge is Tailwind By mistake I installed tailwing in different folder and was trying to apply style but it was not giving required result. 
it took my lots of time to fix this issue.

-Importing types or components with .ts or .tsx caused “cannot find module” errors.
Solution: Removed explicit extensions in imports and relied on TypeScript module resolution:
"-App  couldent  find" : there was problem to give path when import App was importing changed path and it resolved.
-Needed multiple filters (status, priority, search) and sorting by date.
    Solution: Created utility functions:
filterTasks(tasks, filters) → filters tasks based on multiple criteria.
sortTasksByDate(tasks) → sorts tasks by dueDate.
-Needed live form validation and controlled inputs.
    Managed form state with useState.
Added validate() function to check required fields.
Displayed errors using local errors state.

Q3.Your approach to component composition and state management?
Ans:

-Parent component (Dashboard): Holds main state (tasks, filters, darkMode) and orchestrates child components.
-Child components:
    TaskForm → Only handles task input and validation.
    TaskFilter → Handles filter selection and search input.
    TaskList → Receives filtered and sorted tasks, renders a list of TaskItems.
    TaskItem → Handles individual task display, status update, and delete action.

    Props + callbacks: All child-to-parent communication is handled via callbacks (onAddTask, onStatusChange, onDelete, onFilterChange).-

-Centralized in Dashboard using useState.
Derived state (processedTasks) calculated using utility functions:
const processedTasks = sortTasksByDate(filterTasks(tasks, filters));
